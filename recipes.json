Firmly press mixture into bottom and 1 1/2 to 2 inches up the sides of prepared springform pan. Bake until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer springform pan to a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325\u00b0F (165\u00b0C).",

Add granulated sugar and 1/2 cup (3 3/4 ounces; 107 g) brown sugar. Beat on medium-high speed until combined and smooth, about 1 minute. Add eggs, one at a time, beating on low speed until just combined after each addition, stopping to scrape sides of bowl as needed. Add sour cream, vanilla, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Beat on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed. Set aside.",

Transfer cheesecake to wire rack and allow to cool completely, about 1 hour. Refrigerate, uncovered, until fully chilled and set, at least 6 hours or up to 24 hours.",
      "For the Pecan Caramel: After cheesecake has cooled, in a medium saucepan, bring sugar, cream, melted butter, corn syrup, and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt to a simmer over medium heat, whisking occasionally. Once simmering, stop whisking, and continue to simmer, undisturbed, over medium heat, until mixture becomes slightly darker and a candy thermometer registers 224\u00b0F (106\u00b0C), about 2 minutes. Immediately remove from heat and use a flexible rubber spatula or wooden spoon to stir in pecans until coated. Let cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.",

      "Prepare your vegetables. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.",
      "Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.",
      "Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).",
      "Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.",
      "Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.",
      "Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
      "Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.",
      "Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.",
      "Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.",
      "Add a 400g can of chopped tomatoes. Tip in \u00bd tsp dried marjoram, 1 tsp sugar and add a good shake of salt and pepper. Squirt in about 2 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e and stir the sauce well.",
      "Simmer it gently. Bring the whole thing to the boil, give it a good stir and put a lid on the pan. Turn down the heat until it is gently bubbling and leave it for 20 minutes.",
      "Check on the pan occasionally to stir it and make sure the sauce doesn\u2019t catch on the bottom of the pan or isn\u2019t drying out. If it is, add a couple of tablespoons of water and make sure that the heat really is low enough. After simmering gently, the saucy mince mixture should look thick, moist and juicy.",
      "Drain and rinse a 410g can of red kidney beans in a sieve and stir them into the chilli pot. Bring to the boil again, and gently bubble without the lid for another 10 minutes, adding a little more water if it looks too dry.",
      "Taste a bit of the chilli and season. It will probably take a lot more seasoning than you think.",
      "Now replace the lid, turn off the heat and leave your chilli to stand for 10 minutes before serving. This is really important as it allows the flavours to mingle.",
      "Serve with soured cream and plain boiled long grain rice."

    "steps": [
      "Cook the zucchini: Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the zucchini and season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Cook the zucchini, stirring occasionally, until it expels liquid, the liquid cooks off, and the zucchini caramelizes into a jam-like, spreadable consistency, 10 to 12 minutes. If you start to notice any browning at the bottom of your pot, reduce the heat to medium. Once jammy, transfer the zucchini into a medium bowl and set it aside. Simply Recipes / Alison Bickel",
      "Cook the pasta: In the same pot (don\u2019t worry about wiping off any browned bits or pieces of zucchini that might be left in the pot), add 3 1/4 cups water and bring it to a boil over high heat. Season the water with the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Once the water is boiling, add the pasta and cream cheese, and reduce the heat to medium-high. Break up the cream cheese with the back of a wooden spoon to disperse throughout. It\u2019s okay if the pasta isn\u2019t completely submerged in liquid. Cook, stirring frequently until the pasta is al dente and liquid is reduced and creamy, 11 to 13 minutes. If all the moisture cooks off and the pasta is still undercooked, add a splash of water. Simply Recipes / Alison BickelSimply Recipes / Alison Bickel",
      "Add the zucchini back in: Add the cooked zucchini, lemon zest, and lemon juice and cook until warmed through, 2 minutes. Add a splash of water to create a thin, glossy sauce, if needed. Season to taste with salt and pepper, if needed. Divide between bowls and top with toasted walnuts. Serve. Though it\u2019s best enjoyed immediately, you can always refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days and reheat it in the microwave or in a saucepan with a splash of water.
